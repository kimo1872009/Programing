    <h2>Programming languages help us talk to computers. They allow us to give computers instructions. Some common languages are Python, Java, and C++.

        Python is easy to learn and used for many things like websites. Java is good for making apps. C++ is fast and used for games.
        
        Programming languages are important because they let us create technology we use every day.
